                <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the fundamental language
                used to create web pages on the internet. 
                It provides the structure and content of a webpage by using a system of 
                tags and attributes to define elements within a document.</p>
                <p>HTML elements are represented by tags enclosed in angle brackets, like
                &lt;tagname&gt;. These tags can be either paired, meaning they have both 
                an opening and closing tag.</p>

                <code>
                    x = 42;
                </code>

                <p>meaning they don't require a closing tag (e.g., &lt;img&gt; for images). 
                Tags can also include attributes, which provide additional information 
                written as name-value pairs (e.g.,). One of the key concepts in HTML 
                is semantic markup which involves using elements that convey meaning 
                about the content they contain. For example, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;,
                &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; are all semantic elements introduced in HTML5. 
                Using semantic markup not only helps to structure content more clearly but
                also improves accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="structure_HTML">
                <header>Structure HTML</header>
                <p> HTML documents are structured as a hierarchy of elements, starting with 
                the &lt;html&gt; tag, followed by &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; tags. The &lt;head&gt; typically contains 
                meta-information about the document, such as its title and links to stylesheets 
                scripts, while the &lt;body&gt; contains the visible content of the webpage.</p>

                <p>Tags and Elements: HTML elements are defined by tags enclosed in angle brackets 
                (&lt; and &gt;). Tags can be either paired (opening and closing) or self-closing. For
                example, &lt;p&gt; defines a paragraph, &lt;a&gt; defines a hyperlink, and &lt;img&gt; defines an image.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Semantic_HTML">
                <header>Semantic HTML</header>
                <p>Semantic HTML refers to using HTML elements according to their intended purpose or 
                meaning, rather than just for presentation. For instance, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;,
                &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; are all examples of semantic elements introduced in HTML5, which
                help to better structure the content of a webpage and improve its accessibility and search
                engine optimization (SEO).</p>

                <code> 
                    function greetMe(yourName){
                        alert("Hello " + yourName);
                    }
                    greetMe("world");
                </code>

                <p>Here are some key aspects and benefits of using semantic HTML:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clearer Structure: Semantic HTML elements (such as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, 
                    &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, etc.) provide clear indications of the different parts of a webpage,
                    making it easier for developers to understand and maintain the code.</li>
                    <li>Accessibility: Semantic HTML makes web content more accessible to users with disabilities.
                    Screen readers and other assistive technologies rely on semantic HTML to properly interpret
                    and present content to users with visual impairments or other disabilities.</li>
                    <li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Search engines use semantic HTML to better understand the 
                    content and context of web pages. Using semantic elements appropriately can improve the 
                    visibility of a webpage in search engine results pages (SERPs) Consistency and Maintainability:
                    Semantic HTML promotes consistency and maintainability in web development projects. By using 
                    standard semantic elements, developers can create more predictable and easier-to-maintain 
                    codebases.</li>
                </ul>

                <header>Versatility</header>
                <p>HTML's versatility lies in its ability to structure content for the web in a clear and 
                understandable manner. Here are a few aspects of HTML's versatility:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Structuring Content: HTML provides a range of elements that allow developers to structure content semantically. 
                    From headings (&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;) to paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;), lists (&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;li&gt;), tables (&lt;table&gt;, 
                    &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;td&gt;), and more, HTML offers a variety of elements to organize and present information 
                    effectively.</li>
                </ul>
                <code>
                    let y = 13;
                </code>
                <p>Multimedia Integration: HTML supports the integration of multimedia content seamlessly. Elements 
                like &lt;img&gt; for images, &lt;audio&gt; for audio files, &lt;video&gt; for videos, and &lt;iframe&gt; for embedding 
                external content, allow developers to include various media types directly into web pages.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Forms and Input Elements: HTML provides form elements .</li>
                </ul>
                <p>that enable users to interact with web pages by submitting data. This versatility
                allows for the creation of interactive web applications, user registration forms, surveys, and more.</p>
                <p>Accessibility Features: HTML includes accessibility features such as semantic elements (&lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;,
                &lt;main&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, etc.), ARIA roles and attributes, and input types (&lt;input type="email"&gt;, &lt;input
                type="tel"&gt;, etc.), which enhance the accessibility of web content for users with disabilities.</p>

                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                <p>Responsive Design: HTML supports responsive design techniques, allowing developers to create web 
                pages that adapt and respond to different screen sizes and devices. By using techniques like media 
                queries and flexible layout techniques, developers can create websites that look good and function 
                well across a variety of devices, from desktops to smartphones.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Reference">
                <header>Reference</header>
                <p>In HTML, the &lt;reference&gt; tag doesn't exist as a standard tag. However, if you're referring to creating references
                or citations within an HTML document, you typically achieve this using various methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML Comments: You can add references directly into the HTML code as comments.</li>
                    <li>Anchor Links: You can create links within your document that link to references at the bottom of the page or elsewhere.</li>
                    <li>Using Lists: You can use ordered or unordered lists to list your references.</li>
                    <li>Using the &lt;cite&gt; Element: Within text, you can use the &lt;cite&gt; element to denote a citation.</li>
                </ul>
                <code>
                    if (true) {let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
                </code>
                <p>Multimedia Integration: HTML supports the integration of multimedia content seamlessly. Elements 
                like &lt;img&gt; for images, &lt;audio&gt; for audio files, &lt;video&gt; for videos, and &lt;iframe&gt; for embedding 
                external content, allow developers to include various media types directly into web pages.</p>
